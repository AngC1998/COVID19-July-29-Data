Evaluating pandemic severity of each state based on number of cases, death, and metrics relating to popularity through data analysis (data science). 
CVS Data from this Github Repository: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data

**Description of the Project**
- I cleaned and processed a dataset of the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, total population, and land-mass of each US state as of July 29, 2020. 
- I implemented linear regression to determine factors of the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in each state. 
- I programmed the project in Python, and utilized its Matplotlib, Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy libraries. 
- I learned more about linear regression, and certain Statistics concepts such as correlation, p-values, and standard error. 
- Dataset of COVID-19 cases provided by the NY Times through their github repository; population and land-mass data obtained through Google search.
